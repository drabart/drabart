I currently study at TU Delft

I did a lot of competetive programming during highschool in C++ and I love that language.

During my free time I learned to create simple AIs using neural networks (it feels great to 
create something that can learn by itself!).

I also made projects that combined pure coding skills with more electrical and mechanical 
ones using Arduino and Raspberry Pi pico.
